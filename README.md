> Customer Purchasing Behavior

## Problem:
You are a data analyst working with 2Market, a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour. 

## Objective:
2Market wants to understand: 
- The demographics of their customersâ€¨
- Which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic

## Solution:
- Create a dashboard with tableau 
- Dashboard should show an overview of product lines and how the demographics of customer contribute to total revenue of each product line
- Understanding where customers are spending their money, how much they are spending, and which customers are interested in what product line

> ### Specifics of dashboard design:
> - Dashboard title is "Customer Purchase Behavior"
> - Contains six measurable indicators; Total Product Sold, Number of Customers, Average Spent, Advertisement Leads, Percentage of Total Ad Revenue, and Percentage of Total Purchases
> - Purpose of indicators is to provide macro point of view while allowing users to identify specific customer demographic such as; Country (market), Income, Marital Status, and Average age

>**IMPORTANT:** distinguishing feature located on the top right of dashboard entitled "Advert Successes" is the conversion rate. The bar is adjustable allowing users to view customer conversion rate ranging from zero to four. Best use of feature is identify highest conversion rate or have an overview of sales figures excluding sales generated by advertisement efforts.
